It’ll make Tarkov way more fun for me at least if I actually feel confident with combat. 

We can get more reps in one night of Arena than two months of real Tarkov.

The whole creeping around like real life thing isn’t fun when I just die suddenly. I’d rather be sneaking around looking for fights because we’re comfortable fighting.
