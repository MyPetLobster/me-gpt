Totally forgot to scan that inspection sheet this morning before I left! Just set an alarm for when I get home tonight. I have to work at the restaurant for a few nights because one of the chefs cut her finger last night. But I will send that as soon as I get back.

Hey Anthony, the fridge is about 32" deep, 32" wide, and 66" tall. (And there are a few inches of space in every direction). I couldn't see a number for cubic feet on any label. But I just googled it and I'm pretty sure it is 18 cu. ft.

I think it's probably something called blossom-end rot. And I just did a quick search for a solution...it seems like a calcium deficiency might be the cause. They make a calcium spray specifically for tomatoes.

Hey Anthony tomorrow at 9:30 should work for me. Sorry I just saw your text. I have been in the waiting room and had no reception. My dad just had a camera examine his stomach, and the nurse just came out to tell me that the cancer has spread all over beyond his stomach, so it's not good. He has to stay at the hospital, so I'm just waiting to talk to the doctor before I go. If for some reason I will be busy tomorrow morning, I will let you know.

Heat is working! The I couldn't get the burner to stay on, but then I tried bleeding it for a second and there was a tiny pocket of air. After that it worked perfectly.

That makes sense. I did my best not to drip any on the windows but perhaps rain washed a bit of it off sometime in the week or so after I did the last acrylic coat. That makes sense in the timeline of the windows giving us issues too

All set! He will ship me the new panel and waterfall part. As soon as it arrives and the cabin is empty, I‚Äôll see if Ed is available so IÔ∏è can show him how to replace the control panel. This one is the same exact process as the one IÔ∏è did at Black Bear.

And Mel told me that IÔ∏è am able to make repairs on the tub without voiding the warranty (IÔ∏è guess that was something you guys worked out with Bullfrog before purchasing). But he said if IÔ∏è have any trouble, IÔ∏è can call him or have him come down to do it for me.

IÔ∏è really doubt I‚Äôll have any problems though, the panel replacement at Black Bear was surprisingly simple. No caulk/sealant required at all. The adhesive is built onto the backside of the panels.

One of guests at Big Bear left me a voicemail to say that there is no phone or internet. 

And Gretta sent me a text ‚Äî she said nobody has been there to deal with any snow!

Septic inspection went well! No major issues. There's only one problem -- the septic pump alarm box in the basement is on the same breaker as the pump itself. So if the pump fails and trips the breaker, the alarm won't work. So the alarm just needs to be moved to a different circuit breaker. But i don't think it's a major issue

Indeed! I couldn't really break down too deep into that big snow pile, but I shoveled out the path that they will take if they cross over the deck. And I put some sand down too on the side of the cabin so they know it's meant to be a path. I think the last delivery guy was being a little lazy lol

Black Bear tub is working! It was actually my fault, I didn't push one of the new sensors in all the way and it didn't click into place. So the motor vibrating made it come a little loose. I'm at Big Bear now....the rest of the snow came off back roof. It melted and then froze again so it's pretty solid now. I'll try to get as much off as I can before I go.

Sensors were fine, this time the error code was "dry" which means the pump has air in it or something like that. I've seen this error once before after refilling the old tub at Big Bear and I just had to bleed the air out of the line. I did that here but it didn't seem like there was any air in the line at all. So I just flipped the breaker on and off and switched out a filter in case there's something coating the filters that's clogging them up.  And it seems to be working now. No error codes and it's been going for twenty minutes or so. I'll stick around til the temperature rises, but this time I'm at a loss for what could have caused that error code

You can ignore last call. All should be good here now. They will call me in an hour and a half or so and let me know what the temp is.  I need to run to Portland but I'll be able to head back here when they call me if the tub stops working again. They have my number so they won't need to call you again tonight

Yep! I had to order a part for the sink at Black bear. It's only $6. Amazon will have it to me by Thursday. It's definitely the correct part and it will be a very easy fix. Just a plastic piece that snapped.

Gretta is having people over at her place today and my family is up for my bday so I told her I'll be back later this week to finish up. Things are looking good there, I can probably finish up in the time it takes Wayne to install the door. 

Ed thought we were meeting at Big Bear for Christmas decorations this morning, so when I spoke to him I told him that guests don't leave until tomorrow but he could get started on Black Bear Christmas decorations since he was already out that way.

Hm...I'll see if Ed might be able to stop by on his way home from work. And if I have other stuff to keep me busy at the cabin til then, that'll be good. Otherwise I can just post an ad for $20 or $25 and have someone meet me there just to help move it. But I think Ed will be able to help me out, and he's really quite good at moving stuff now.

All good at North High. The tank filled up because the pump to the leech field is broken. They said it's a really simple fix, just the float part. But they pumped the tank and they will be back out next week with the part. I told holly and Gretta that they'll be stopping by to do that. They won't need to go inside for anything and it'll only take a few minutes so I won't need to come out to meet them, unless you think I should.

Any thoughts on parking for one Day when driveway is done?

Mar 31, 2018 12:51:00 PM

There is a curb there so they won't be able to drive onto the lawn without going over the driveway. Maybe I could get in touch with the people who own the place across the street and ask if they could park on that dirt road/driveway for one day. I haven't seen anybody there for a while though so not sure how I'd contact them. And there's no space on north high street to park on the road itself.

Hey, I was looking for the wrong door! The info Wayne wrote down for me was assuming we were going to use a separate storm door. But when I spoke to you after that, we decided to go with the same door we used in the back. 

Do you have the information on that specific door in your records? If not, I can call Wayne or see if Gretta can send me a picture. Or even if you know the price of the door, that will help me figure it out. There are so many doors that look similar and the price range is all over the place

Hey I forgot to give 24 hour notice. But I called Kelley earlier and rescheduled for Monday morning at 9:30am. I had to give her notice bc I‚Äôll need to go inside to get the storm door from the basement. 

Also, more of the fence in the backyard has fallen down. Is it okay if I ask Ed to stop by and help me with the fence on Monday if I can‚Äôt get it on my own?

Hm, not sure how I can get the sand out of the tub without draining it. Maybe the net‚Äôs mesh is fine enough to hold the sand and I can just scoop it all out. I‚Äôll figure something out!

Hey! I did not hang up the flowers at BBC yet. I wanted to give the deck a few more days of sunlight to dry/cure the paint before I start pumping water. The water lines are all connected and in put in place with the timer, so all we have to do is hang the pots and turn the water on. 

Also, I cannot move the dog cage by myself. I think Nick is working with me tomorrow and/or Friday at NHS, so we can stop by BBC to move the dog cage at some point.

Trying to figure out what happen to camera at Black Bear?

Sep 18, 2018  6:13:23 PM
Me
Hey, I‚Äôm not sure how it fell. I brought Elianna there today to show her the cabin while I did a final run through and I didn‚Äôt even notice that the camera had swung downward. I just noticed it caught some motion earlier...maybe there‚Äôs a squirrel or chipmunk jumping around the roof and stepped on the camera. It‚Äôs quite easy to readjust so the weight of a small critter...or a falling stick etc would be enough to knock it down. A simple solution would be to just screw a small piece of wood into the corner of the shed, right below the camera. That would support it if it fell again.

Showing went well! Young guy who lives in Gray. Looking for a property to rent out to tenants. Seemed like he was genuinely interested too. I‚Äôm gonna guess that you‚Äôll hear from him soon. And hopefully he doesn‚Äôt just make a lowball offer. 

He has had his eye on the property for at least a little while. He made a few comments that let me know he has either driven by and looked, or really done research.

Hey Anthony. Power is still out at both cabins. The generator is running at Big Bear but internet is down. I could not open the generator...I found the key and instruction manual but couldn‚Äôt get the door to budge. However, I looked everything up online and I believe the following information is all accurate:

It‚Äôs called the Kohler 12RES. The part number for the whole machine is 1870070. 

And here‚Äôs a direct link to the exact mode on Kohler‚Äôs website ‚Äî

For the time being, I got a bright LED nightlight for the center bulb in the fixture. That part of the fixture is still working...but the regular candelabra bulbs we had here were not bright enough.

No, you‚Äôre right; it‚Äôs not your imagination. Last time she worked alone, I think she was at Black Bear for 6-7 hours and when I went to do a final check, there was still a lot left to do. But she‚Äôs thorough and I don‚Äôt notice her going so slow when she‚Äôs working with me or Brenda. But the last three turnovers I needed the extra cash anyway, so I just did it with Brenda.

I definitely checked it and balanced it all. I didn‚Äôt notice it being low...I usually fill it up when the jets are spraying out of the water. It‚Äôs an easy way to tell if it needs water. So there‚Äôs a chance it was slightly below the indicator mark.

Could it have been a previous guest? If I saw the name but never actually met him in person, that would explain why I feel like I have seen the name before.  I tried searching through old reservations, but if it was from more than 2 years ago, I might not be able to find it.

Hey yes it did. Young couple who seemed interested. The real estate agent didn‚Äôt arrive until they were leaving. And they stuck around for a while. Both tenants had their places looking really nice and clean. Better than I‚Äôve seen them ever look. 

The couple lives in Sebago currently. I guess it‚Äôs a big house, so they‚Äôre trying to downsize. They have two kids. Very excited about backyard. But I think they‚Äôve got a bunch of other showings scheduled. Real estate agents name was Jackie. And the guy who was looking is named Trey.

Hey Anthony, heading to North High Street to seal the roof. I had some of the ‚ÄúThrough the Roof‚Äù product left over at home, so I am going to use that up before I buy any more. I think it should be enough. 

But I just stopped at True Value in Bridgton to pick up the paint I‚Äôll need for bathroom walls at Federal Street. They have the color on file, I got the color info so I can add it to file at Ames in Wiscasset. 

That‚Äôs what the $77 charge on your card is for. I‚Äôll be heading back up there this week after work at North High is done.

Ricks still here, but going well. I think he‚Äôs almost done. Hard to reach the pipes. They‚Äôre all in the shortest part of the crawl space area...in the furthest corner.

Yep! It was working for a while and I thought you must have turned off the motion capture to stop getting a notification every time someone walked by. But I just tried to turn it on and no luck.

I just got to my moms place. But I will troubleshoot that tomorrow and also finish trying to reinstall the iSmeye cameras. They wouldn‚Äôt finish downloading firmware update earlier, so I just left them to continue updating.

Oil sensor should be working properly now. No idea what was wrong. I just ended up disconnecting it from WiFi then reconnecting it. The batteries were fine. And I also learned that regular AA batteries do not work.

Don‚Äôt think we will need to replace the anytime soon, but in case you want to order them sooner here‚Äôs a picture the info.

Hey, ive been noticing a funky smell over at North High. Not sure if it‚Äôs just the rain kicking up the smells of dog poop and just misty rainy smell. But I‚Äôm worried it might be a septic issue. Septic seems to be working fine, but I keep getting whiffs of the odor. Anyway, just wanted to see if you had any thoughts or ideas.

Your inclination of dog poop may be right. Let‚Äôs not take chances, this morning a couple of boxes of RidX down from Caitlyn‚Äôs side, also please check crawl space for leaky pipe, hate sending you under there

Jun 21, 2019  7:22:25 AM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
Will do. I just got back over to north high and went down to explore the crawl space. All looks okay down there. And actually, the smell is stronger on the opposite side of the home. Perhaps the neighbors are due for a septic pump out?

Also did some research yesterday and it seems like heavy rain and atmospheric pressure can cause the smell. First, the rain will slow the leaching action of the field. And secondly, the atmospheric pressure can keep the methane down near ground level instead of dissipating. Plus, everything just smells more in the wet rainy weather. 

Hardware store was closed on my ride over, but I‚Äôll take a trip to grab some RidX shortly.

All set. I just ended up taking it all apart and doing a thorough cleaning. The tinfoil pan was not full of crumbs or grease. And it was actually me who cleaned it the other day. 

The last group of renters REALLY used it heavily, but I thought I cleaned it up well enough. However, I believe I missed all the grease that must have splashed all over the side walls and parts below. In my defense, it did not appear to be dirty. But I bet there was a coating of grease on everything. And when I ran the grill the other day to clean it, all the grease from up top probably liquified and ran down below. 

After googling, it seems like this can happen after you cook very fatty meats. Normally with hot dogs and burgers, it‚Äôs not a problem. Either way, from now on I will be sure to check all parts of the grill for grease. I‚Äôll make it a part of regular cleaning.

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre too thin. Should work great. Didn‚Äôt have any problems with there‚Äôs thinner bags up in wiscasset. And in the barrels at Big Bear, guests usually put kitchen trash bags into these bags, so thinner bags shouldn‚Äôt be a problem at all

Cory, I see a cancelled showing for Bridgton. I know Steve is in California. Can you give him a buzz and let him know what days you are in the lakes region?

Hey!! I just finished a showing at North High. Had to do some creative rescheduling with Steve to meet the 24hr notice for tenants. That‚Äôs probably why you saw a cancelled appointment...I got it switched from morning to the afternoon. 

It went really well!! One older lady and she seems extremely interested. She wants to live in the smaller side and I think continue to rent the other. Not sure about that though. But I have a good feeling about this one! ü§û 

I‚Äôve had to deal with a few issues at the cabin and north high, but nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle....so far lol. But renters at Big Bear are in love with the place and all tenants are happy. I‚Äôm holding down the fort!

Hope you are all having an amazing trip!! I watched a documentary called Wild Alaska the other day and made me even more jealous üòÅ.  Oh and I just noticed that picture you sent of my doppelg√§nger...and it made me actually laugh out loud!!! That‚Äôs so funny. Lol. If you ever buy a place in Alaska, you should try and find him and hire him to manage the place. Hah

So I have already scheduled an extra helper from Craigslist for the day on Saturday. Plus, Elianna and Brenda will be coming as well.

Seems like Ben Moore makes the standard tiers of exterior, just like interior. 

‚ÄúAura‚Äù is best...
‚ÄúRegal‚Äù is 2nd best...
‚ÄúBen‚Äù is the cheapest

I think Regal will be sufficient. I don‚Äôt notice much of a difference between aura and regal interior paint. I also saw that they make an alkyd based paint called Moorglo/Moorgard. Which is similar to the Moorwhite primer. Not sure if there would be any benefit or drawbacks with that stuff. I‚Äôve never tried it. The people at the hardware store might have some advice

Hey I just tried opening the app and I got logged out somehow. I know BostonAnthony@hotmail is the email address used. But I forget the password. There might be a piece of paper in the router closet with the password on it. If not, you can reset the password with your email address in the app after a failed login attempt. 

I used Zoegirl123 for all passwords if possible. But Plume must be one of the apps with weird password requirements. I think I remember that I couldn‚Äôt use 3 sequential numbers. Anyway, let me know if you have trouble resetting it

The new batteries for the phone should arrive this afternoon. I‚Äôll stop home to check before I head back to the cabin. At NHS now. Think I might have finally found the damn distribution box.

Hey, I spoke to Shawn. He‚Äôs coming by this evening to dig around some more. But I talked to him and told him about everything I‚Äôve found so far. Hopefully he can give you more answers than me! 

Wish I could have figured it out. But I‚Äôm still pretty confused and now I smell awful and have stinky mud all over myself lol. Every hole I dig is filling up with water so even if I find the distribution box, i think it‚Äôll be below the water level. But maybe I‚Äôm just reading the diagram wrong and looking in the wrong place. I‚Äôm hoping Shawn can provide some answers.

Hey, can you give me a call when you‚Äôre done teaching if you get a chance?

I‚Äôm coming up to Wiscasset tomorrow morning instead of today...I just left the cabin. Hot tub was not working. Long story, but I got it fixed. 

Even though I need to be back at the cabin Sunday, I‚Äôd still like to come up to Wiscasset for the day tomorrow to meet the new guys and work on the bathroom. I prefer driving early in the morning rather than tonight...so my plan is to arrive in wiscasset by 7:30/8:00am. If that works for you. 

Oh, and while I was at the cabin I tested the heat system and brought it the temp up a few degrees...all working perfectly as far as I can tell.

Got it! Also, I just tried all three apples and they are all delicious! But the ones that are leaning into the neighbors yard are THE BEST!!  They taste sooo good. One of the best apples I‚Äôve ever tried, not even exaggerating.  

But the worms are eating those more than the rest. And I needed a ladder to reach good ones lol. But it was worth it

Won‚Äôt work remotely when the power is out. When the WiFi is down at the house, we won‚Äôt be able to access the system.

Showing went well. They were a very nice middle aged couple. And I think they are really interested in the place. They were asking about the other offer you have and how likely that is to workout. I told them I‚Äôm out of the loop with all that. But their real estate agent said he would speak to Kamal to answer any of those questions. 

Didn‚Äôt see Jamie or Caitlyn today. But the back door on Jamie‚Äôs side is definitely in bad shape. Might be noticed in an inspection and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs repairable or if it‚Äôll need to be replaced. 

I got the measurements I need for Caitlyns kitchen light. So I‚Äôll be buying and installing that this weekend, depending on which day is best for her. And when I am back here doing that, I‚Äôll take a closer look at Jamie‚Äôs back door in the daylight when it‚Äôs not pouring rain.

Hey, at one point a few months ago we left a spare key for Judd under a rock. I‚Äôm not sure what happened to that key. 

But I was just thinking of other options, and I have an idea! Cory might be able to get into the house via the crawl space. I don‚Äôt think that exterior hatch/door has a lock. Cory is a bit larger than I am, but I think he can fit through the opening into the basement lol. 

Then he will need to use something flat like a credit card in order to flip the basement door latch leading into the dining room.

$43.90 charge on debit card at Home Depot is for North High St. 

I forgot that I told Caitlyn I‚Äôd be over today to install a new light fixture. I may have found a better, cheaper solution. They make new individual track light heads that have accept standard sized LED bulbs. None of those weird specialty bulbs. 

So I bought 3 new light heads and 3 LED bulbs. All of the full fixtures they sell now come with ‚Äúintegrated NON-replaceable bulb‚Äù. I don‚Äôt trust that too much. Plus the cheapest ones are $90. So if this works it‚Äôll be half the price and easy to replace bulbs in the future.

Any word from the North High St buyer? I told Bob I‚Äôd let him know if the deal is done. I guess he saw online that it switched from ‚Äúaccepting offers‚Äù to something like ‚Äúdeal pending‚Äù.

Hey, shower window measurements are 18‚Äùx36‚Äùx4.25‚Äù  and a spare key is under the green jug on the porch.

Oct 02, 2019  8:52:45 AM (Read by them after 1 second)

Also, you can probably cancel Spectrum. It looks like someone just tripped over the extension cord and pulled the plug on the whole utility closet and all routers/modems etc. Everything came right back up when I plugged it back in. 

And it also turns out that August porch door lock just had dead batteries. Worked perfectly when I put 4 new AA in. But as far as I can tell, there‚Äôs no way in the app to even monitor battery levels. So I expect the same problem to arise with the kitchen lock soon. Do you want me to replace the stock batteries in that one now? Or wait until it dies now that we have the spare key outside?

You too! One quick question...do you remember if Todd ever came to North High a Street after the buyers inspection last year noted some loose hot wires and issues with the junction box in the crawl space etc?

I know you reached out to him, but I can‚Äôt recall if he ever came out to make those repairs. I was just going through my head thinking of anything that Bob might ask me next time I see him. And the only problems that I can think of are those minor electrical issues. I won‚Äôt mention anything at all unless he asks...but if he does ask, I don‚Äôt want to hide any potentially dangerous things like a live wire dangling out of a wall lol.

When you go over to work on door can you check the live wire issue? I don‚Äôt remember that one at all. Worse case is when tenants move we POWER DOWN the entire and then you can tape them and throw a wire wrap on them.

Yep power has been good. Lucky...I think there are still a lot of homes in the area without power. It really felt like an apocalypse driving today lol. I came across  two intersections where the lights were just completely dead. No cops around nothing. But it was shocking...every person was treating it like a four way stop. A minor miracle lol.

Me
Card is destroyed. And you‚Äôre very welcome. Thank you!! I‚Äôm so glad you guys decided to get the house in Wiscasset and not some other place in another state far away. üòÅ.

Speaking of Wiscasset, I am going to be busy in Portland on Saturday. I‚Äôm waiting to hear when the guests in Portland are going to arrive on Friday. If they aren‚Äôt arriving until the evening, I will likely go to Wiscasset early on Friday. That way I can check in with Cory M to make sure things are looking good. And I can also get a few more things done myself. 

We should probably try to close up the mud room floor and any remaining exterior work by next Monday. Looks like that might be the end of good warm weather for the year. So if I end up stuck in Portland on Friday and Saturday, I‚Äôll definitely make it up there on Sunday/Monday to make sure everything is ready for freezing temps. I‚Äôll take a look around the barn to make sure no paint or anything is left. And I‚Äôll deal with the lattice under the front deck as well.

Hey Anthony sorry to bug you on a nice Saturday night in Wiscasset, but I just got a call from Lincoln. He said that the burner isn‚Äôt working. He said that there‚Äôs a quarter tank so it‚Äôs not a low oil problem. He tried to bleed it in case any air got in the line, but he said it seems like the whole thing has no power. He couldn‚Äôt even try to reset it. There‚Äôs usually a green light, but no lights are on. 

Lincoln knows as much or more than I do about oil burners, so if he can‚Äôt figure it out I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have much luck either. Plus, I know that burners can go into ‚Äúlock-out‚Äù or something for safety reasons in order to prevent people who aren‚Äôt professionals from dealing with a potentially dangerous issue.

Any ideas at all? Should I try calling Brad?

Nov 02, 2019  7:49:42 PM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
Scratch that!  I‚Äôm getting good at this property management thing. Right before I texted you I sent Lincoln a message to check the breaker....and it worked!! Seems to be working fine again. But no idea why that would happen. And now not sure if it‚Äôs an electric thing or a burner thing.

Either way, no immediate issue. I told Lincoln to call me if it happens again. Have a good night! 

PS I‚Äôll be up in Wiscasset Monday and Tuesday. I purchased the barn trim a couple days ago and got it primed and painted in the workshop of the bookstore in Portland. Also did the same with the quarter round for the bathroom. I‚Äôll close up all the lingering items on my list.

Also, Frank Snow got back to me and he would love to take the job in the springtime, but he doesn‚Äôt have the right equipment to do the job when the ground might be frozen. He recommended waiting until spring if possible bc any emergency installation in the frozen ground will be more expensive. I told him that likely isn‚Äôt an option. 

He also told me that he personally knows the woman next door, and he seriously doubts that she would allow trucks and equipment to use that dirt road adjacent to the house in order to reach the backyard. I guess that lady is a little crazy lol. Frank was also concerned about how he would manage to get equipment into the backyard. 

Have you gone ahead with the emergency installation company? Should I try to look around for anyone else in the area?

You‚Äôre welcome!!! I‚Äôm so glad she loved it. I haven‚Äôt seen it at night yet, I hope it looks good in the dark. 

Sorry just saw this message, up late last night and slept like the dead until 9:30 this morning lol. Must have read the text while half asleep. 

Anyway, I just met Bob and his wife Kristin at North High. They came with their real estate agent to take a quick walkthrough. I guess Bobs wife hasn‚Äôt even seen the place yet. But she really loves the house. They both seem so excited, and also frustrated with the bank or whatever is delaying things. They seem very eager to get the deal done and get the house rented! Hopefully it‚Äôs all done soon. And hope you and CJ have a great weekend!!

Toilet is here

Dec 14, 2019  1:01:00 PM (Read by them after 3 seconds)

Since that bathroom heater was leaking, my guess was that it allowed air into the line. Then that air is what was stopping the hot liquid from reaching that porch heater. 

I could feel exactly where the pipe went from cold to hot at the elbow heading to the porch. I bet there was an air pocket right there. Hopefully they sorted that out. But if not, I think I can actually bleed it myself.

And I will speak to Cory to figure out our schedules. 

Do you want me to replace the old toilet on my next trip? I‚Äôll make sure Cory will be there so he can help me move it up the stairs.

Technical question, if I want to drive barn Xmas lights off of a Samsung outlet module, I assume I need to put a SmartThings wireless hub out there communicating with one in main house? This may be too expensive to do and I may be stuck with timers like at Big Bear

Got several items on the list done today. 

I skipped the sconces because I‚Äôd rather hang those when you and CJ are here. It‚Äôs hard for me to get the height right without an extra set of eyes.

I also did not put the fiberglass insulation up yet. I want to let the expanding foam finish drying/curing so I can check to make sure I didn‚Äôt leave any gaps there. I‚Äôll cover it with the fiberglass next Saturday, unless Cory gets it done this week. 

The new toilet paper holder is installed, but I had to use black screws. I put a coat of metal primer and a coat of white paint on the screws. But it will need one more coat of paint next weekend. 

I‚Äôll be going to my mom‚Äôs for one more night. I‚Äôll get you my hours for this weekend and last Saturday once I get home tomorrow. Thanks!!

Hey sorry for the delay, just got back home. I think figured out how to transfer the ownership. I just changed it all, so I think you should receive an email in a second with some kind of notification that your email address is now assigned to the Nest account. But if not, the email address I set it to is bostonanthony@hotmail, and the password is Zoegirl_123

Once you login, you should be able to set the email address and password to whatever you want. 

Give me a call if you have any problems. When I was reading online, it seemed like people were very confused about this. So I might be overlooking something obvious...but it seems pretty simple

What is the symbol between Zoegirl and 123? Where is it on your keyboard? May be a translation issue on symbol

Mar 01, 2020  6:45:48 PM (Read by them after 1 second)
Me
Underscore. On the iPhone, once you are in the numbers/symbols keyboard, you have to hit the ‚Äú#+=‚Äú key on the bottom left. That opens up the extended symbol menu. And the dash key - will turn into the underscore _.

Sorry...that was much simpler on my PC lol! Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to just change it again

Hey! I just sent you my invoice plus an action list I made to stay on a tight schedule next week. But I just noticed that I sent the file that includes the list I made for this week the other day. 

If you scroll down in the PDF or Word file, you‚Äôll see the second page with my list for the week of 6/01.

Earliest downeast can deliver is next Tuesday. So I set that in case I can‚Äôt find cheaper. I can cancel up until day of.

I left her a voicemail to find out who it was.

In the meantime, I‚Äôll deliver the last 15 gallons I was planning to bring tomorrow morning. That will cover us through until Tuesday in case I have to stick with Downeast.

Hard to really see in picture but I like the light color. It‚Äôs still drying so difficult to get a good angle without glare. 

Not sure how much darker another coat will make it. And is the color the only reason he recommends a second coat? Or is it to help with longevity?

It wasn‚Äôt that painful at all when I actually passed the kidney stone. That‚Äôs part of the reason I panicked‚Ä¶.kidney stone didn‚Äôt cross my mind. I was so confused. 

But if that stomach ache came from a tiny kidney stone, I never want to experience any worse. I‚Äôll be hydrating better from now on 

Sounds good, see you Sunday!

Hey Anthony, I‚Äôm so sorry but I had the same kind of pain again yesterday, but I was able to work through it. Thought I could make it to my doctor appointment Wednesday but it got a lot worse and more frequent overnight

Hey, I have several more kidney stones üòû. ‚Ä¶none are very big. They gave me prescription for medication that‚Äôs supposed to relax muscles to make it easier, painkillers, and a strainer to catch them for analysis (gross).

I just got a call from him two days ago‚Ä¶.turns out they‚Äôre going to be staying in NJ at least for a while. After his fianc√©es dad passed away in October, things have been chaotic. 

Kim didn‚Äôt want to leave/said she‚Äôs not ready to leave yet. So Nick has decided to stay with her to try to work through it all. 

So for now seems like 99% chance they‚Äôre staying in Jersey. But his number is -

Already did, no worries at all. They were great. Can‚Äôt believe how fast they worked. 

And I just recently saw a local company flooring job in Portland that was a disaster. These guys put extra matching 1/4 round moulding in the kitchen to hide any gaps.

It looks professional like it should. 

Cynthia up the road from you had an absolute nightmare with her kitchen flooring last year. So I was worried. But this worked out great.

Hey, every item has been crossed of the lists except the following ‚Äî

1. I need to buy 2 posts to secure fence. I‚Äôll pick that up tonight and finish fence repair tomorrow while I‚Äôm onsite with Ricky‚Äôs cleaner. 

2. I need to make one more dump run 

3. I need to buy air freshener and new welcome mat (will do that tonight) 

4. Buy one more cabinet crayon to finish touch ups. 

I‚Äôll give you a call tomorrow before I leave the property for a final talk. And I have my checklist ready for early Tuesday morning with flowers and sculptures for photographer. 

I‚Äôll also send you some before and after pics once cleaner is done tomorrow.

Hey, the dishwasher needs new control assembly. I‚Äôm 80% sure that will fix it.

Getting power to the dishwasher itself but the control panel is dead. It‚Äôll light up briefly but that‚Äôs it. 

I will text you in a couple hours after I find some prices on the control assembly if it‚Äôs available anywhere. 

I cleaned out the impeller area and there were no obstructions at all.

No luck at all finding any control panels available for that model dishwasher. Every single website says ‚Äúitem no longer available‚Äù

The part number we need is - maytag 6-915758

But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to have luck finding one. 

The control board might be repairable. But if it is, it‚Äôs beyond my capabilities. 

When I get home this evening, I will take a look around Facebook marketplace/Craigslist. Maybe I‚Äôll get lucky and find someone giving away an old dishwasher with a panel that will fit.

If you want to go with the new dishwasher route‚Ä¶.the size of the cabinet is the standard 24x24x35 so pretty much any option will work. 

I did a quick Google and seems like the best affordable options come from LG and Whirlpool. They have some options in the $500-$600 range. I‚Äôll look more tonight

It is surreal. Other good news is the Go Fund me site has broken $14,000. This should at least cover his deductible. He will have a lot of other bills. He is a fighter but truly the years ahead will be challenging. Be sure you maintain decent insurance. Good lesson to us all.

Feb 21, 2023  7:11:50 PM

It‚Äôs the remote adapter combined with the plug itself. Makes it stick out pretty far so the weight just made it fall forward when the old duct tape came loose. 

Honestly, the waterproof gorilla tape I put on should be more than enough.

But when you‚Äôre back in the spring I‚Äôll take a look and see if maybe I can cut a 2x4 to prop under the outlet to keep the weight from being a problem at all.

She‚Äôs doing much better lately with physical therapy and has an appointment scheduled to consult with an amazing surgeon in Boston next month.

Hey, just got here. I have the replacement cedar window sill and casings that I cut at home. I‚Äôm going paint them in the barn.

No worries BUT I think it is time . I am emailing you my consumer reports login. In 30+ years I have bought cars, appliances, lawn equipment and not one bad recommendation. They take no advertising so super objective. I know trucks are expensive but you need reliable transportation and winter is coming. As for cars I look for 3 years old with under 50,000 miles and have never been burned

Hey! Got my truck back yesterday. Guess what? It was a loose muffler mount making a weird vibration only at certain RPMs. They didn‚Äôt even charge me a cent for fixing it lol. I‚Äôm just happy they finally figured it out and it was nothing major. It was driving me insane. 

Up at my moms today but going to stop by Wiscasset tomorrow. Not sure how much time I‚Äôll have, but I‚Äôll get started on the fridge at least. Then I‚Äôll be back up next week. I‚Äôll give you a call tomorrow to see if there‚Äôs anything else you want me to check on at the house while I‚Äôm there. I‚Äôll put plastic on the upstairs bathroom window 

Happy Thanksgiving!! Hope you and CJ are having a wonderful day.

Well, I‚Äôll definitely be heading up that way in the next couple weeks to go up to my moms. So I‚Äôll take Rt 1 and go through Wiscasset. Is there snow on the ground in Wiscasset now?

We got a few inches down here last week. But we have some warm weather and rain in a few days so I think it‚Äôll all melt. 

Keep me updated on the snow in Wiscasset. If it gets bad, I‚Äôll be happy to take a drive up for half a day to shovel.

Let me know if there‚Äôs anything else you‚Äôd like me to work on during any of the trips up. I think I‚Äôll still wait until spring to tackle the fridge painting, but perhaps I could clean up/organize the basement or something for a few hours one day when I come up for the snow?

Merry Christmas!!! Hope you all had a wonderful day. I had a great relaxing Christmas with mom up in Rockport. 

Just stopped by the house in Wiscasset. I reset the tripped breaker outside for porch lights and re-taped the outlet. Also put a little water in CJs plant and replaced batteries in a beeping smoke detector. 

Pellet stove is looking good. Hardly any pellets used since last time I was here.

Dec 26, 2023 11:45:46 AM

I went to do a final walk around the property and the outlet was tripped again. I tried narrowing the problem down by removing all spotlights and adding one by one. But the outlet is tripping even with no lights plugged in. 

So I‚Äôm 90% sure the GFCI outlet itself is bad. 

I‚Äôm coming back up to my mom‚Äôs this coming weekend to do Christmas part 2 with my aunts. I‚Äôll bring my tools and buy a new outdoor gfci outlet and try installing that either this Friday or Sunday!

Hey, I was pretty sure all we did was shut off the breaker. But now that you ask, I‚Äôm trying to remember and coming up blank on whether I drained the hot water tank or not. 

The weird thing is that I can‚Äôt picture where the shutoff valve would be for the hot water tank. Which makes me think I didn‚Äôt turn it off. 

Are your guests having trouble with the hot water? If you can have them take some photos of the water heater and the pipes around it, it may spark my memory.
