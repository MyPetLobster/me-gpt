Totally forgot to scan that inspection sheet this morning before I left! Just set an alarm for when I get home tonight. I have to work at the restaurant for a few nights because one of the chefs cut her finger last night. But I will send that as soon as I get back.

Seems to only be the kitchen. The one in the bathroom actually dragged itself there from one of the traps I left under the oven. I also unplugged and pulled the oven and cleaned the crumbs down there.

Cory, please text over measurements for refrigerator so I can go on web and look around. Any idea how many cubic feet that is?

Hey Anthony, the fridge is about 32" deep, 32" wide, and 66" tall. (And there are a few inches of space in every direction). I couldn't see a number for cubic feet on any label. But I just googled it and I'm pretty sure it is 18 cu. ft.

When I get home I will head on to Consumer Reports and find a reasonable price unit that Seavey's can order

We have power at the cabins!! Thankfully. I was worried about laundry lol. And the modern Pest guy did not see any ants or mice lol of course...  but he did the initial treatment in both apartments and around the exterior. They'll be back in two weeks for the first follow up

Getting dark brown almost black circles on bottom of tomatoes üçÖ? Any suggestions?

Jul 18, 2017 12:08:07 PM

I think it's probably something called blossom-end rot. And I just did a quick search for a solution...it seems like a calcium deficiency might be the cause. They make a calcium spray specifically for tomatoes.

Yep that looks like what I thought. I also remember that the first few earliest tomatoes on each plant always had some of that regardless of anything we did.

I just deposited them via my phone this morning. Takes a couple days for them to actually verify though
